# testCoding

Problem Statement:
To take the temperature(both in degree celsius and Fahrenheit) and humidity of any Indian city from NDTV website and then comparing its temperature from openweather api (https://openweathermap.org/current) with some variance logic for each of the attribute of weather

Solution:
For this I have created Java based framework using following libraries:
Selenium - 3.12.0
TestNG - 6.8.8
Rest Assured - 3.0.2
org.json - 20190722
This is a Maven based project.

Variables like City name, variance, browser type are configurable and can be changed in config.properties
